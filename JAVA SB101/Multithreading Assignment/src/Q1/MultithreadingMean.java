//What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?

//		Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in
//		parallel. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A
//		simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. This is a single-threaded application.
//		But, if the programming language supports creating multiple threads and passes them to the operating system to run
//		in parallel, itâ€™s called multithreading.

//its doesnot block the user because threads are independent and you can multiple task at the same time.
//you can perform many operation together at the same time .
//Threads are the independent
