The default Maven lifecycle consists of 8 major steps or phases for compiling, testing, building and installing a given Java project as specified below:

--Validate: This step validates if the project structure is correct. For example              It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are                    available in the local repository.
-Compile: It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and               stores the classes in target/classes folder.
-Test: It runs unit tests for the project.
-Package: This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR             or WAR.
-Integration test: It runs the integration tests for the project.
-Verify: This step runs checks to verify that the project is valid and meets the           quality standards.
-Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
-Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with          other developers.
