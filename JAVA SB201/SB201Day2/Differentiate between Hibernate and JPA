Answer:-

Hibernate is an Object/Relational Mapping solution for Java environments. Object-relational mapping or 
ORM is the programming technique to map application domain model objects to the relational database 
tables. Hibernate is a java based ORM tool that provides a framework for mapping application domain 
objects to the relational database tables and vice versa.
Hibernate provides a reference implementation of Java Persistence API, that makes it a great choice as an
ORM tool with benefits of loose coupling. As we know that JPA is just a specification, meaning there 
is no implementation. You can annotate your classes as much as you would like with JPA annotations,
however, without an implementation, nothing will happen. Think of JPA as the guidelines that must be 
followed or an interface, while Hibernate's JPA implementation is code that meets the API as defined by
the JPA specification and provides the under the hood functionality.
