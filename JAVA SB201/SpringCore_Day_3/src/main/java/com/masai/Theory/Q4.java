//	What is auto wiring in Spring, how many types of Auto wiring are there in spring,
//	explain with an example.
	
//	The process of creating association between/among application components is known
//	as "wiring".(variable is wired with appropriate object)
//
//	
//	We have 2 kind of wiring in spring application:
//		
//		1. Explicit wiring
//		
//		2. Auto-wiring (implicit wiring)
//		
//		If a spring developer specifies the associations for the dependency bean by
//		<property> tag or <constructor-arg> tag, it is known as explicit wiring.
//		
//		
//		Whereas if spring container on its own detects the dependencies implicitly and
//		injecting them into the dependent bean is known as "auto-wiring".
	
	
//	For Example:--
//	<bean id="sb" class="com.masai.daoApp.ServiceBean" autowire="byType" />
//
//	<bean id="service" class="com.masai.daoApp.ServiceBean" autowire="byName" />
