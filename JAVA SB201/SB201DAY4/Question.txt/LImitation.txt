 What are the limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
DB?
 Ans =>
       In Entity manager to perform CRUD operation we use 
       persist(),find(),merge() and remove() methods.

       So in this,In persist() method we can get object on based on only primary key
       not by any other paramaters.

       if we need to find multiple record it's not possible in this.Like in JDBC we can get 
       ResultSet and get the multiple records but in this it's not possible.

       if we want to update and delete more than one records it's not possible in this.

       if we want to access a specific type of records we can enter any conditions.
