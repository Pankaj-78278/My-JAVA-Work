//Q2	Explain about IOC and Dependency Injection?
	
//	1> Spring IOC(Inversion of Control) is the core of Spring Framework.it create the Object
//	configure and assembles their dependencies,manages their entire life cycle.
//	
//	2> it is the mechanism to achieve losse coupling and dynamic binding of the objets 
//	at runtime ,objects ependencies are injected by other assembler objects.
//	
//	3>it allow classes to be lossely couples and therefore easier test and maintain.
	
//	- What is Dependency Injection ? :
	
//	1>It is to manage the components the make up the application 
//	
//	2>It is spring Framework through which the spring container "injects" objects into other
//	 or "dependencies"
//	 
//	3> dependency Injection makes our programming code lossely coupled . 
//	
//	4> to overcome the mainly two prroblem  Depency injection make;
//	a> Tight Coupling btw the classes;
//	b> Not easy for testing ;
